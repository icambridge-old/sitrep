A defunk project. It was something I was working on while at one job since there were lots of issues around Pull Requests and CI that could use being automated. Since leaving that I stopped working on it.

Pretty much the only useful thing this does at the moment is approves/unapproves a pull request based on the build status in Jenkins.
